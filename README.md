SpringBoot OAuth Client Sample
==============================

forked from [kogayushi/spring\-boot\-starter\-security\-2\.2\.4\-oauth\-client\-sample](https://github.com/kogayushi/spring-boot-starter-security-2.2.4-oauth-client-sample)

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

run build at first on docker-compose up, so it takes a few minutes to get up the app service.
